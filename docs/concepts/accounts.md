## Accounts on Vega
The Vega system uses `accounts` for a few different purposes. They include segregating assets that you've deposited and can withdraw, or setting money aside that you can't access -- to fulfil margin requirements, for example, or to store assets that are earmarked for rewards or paying out fees.

## Accounts you can manage
general 


## Accounts controlled by the protocol
margin, (liquidity) bond, transfers, double entry accounting
