# Welcome! 

Welcome to Vega! This is a work-in-progress documentation site. 

If you have questions, join our community on [Discord](https://vega.xyz/discord)! We're keen to help.

## What is Vega?â€‹
Vega is a protocol for creating and trading derivatives on a fully decentralised network. 

Currently, Vega is in alpha mainnet, which is run by a set of validators. There's also a Vega testnet called Fairground, where it's possible to try trading cash-settled futures on a test network.

## What is Vega's alpha mainnet? 
Alpha mainnet is the second decentralised version of the Vega network. The second step of a three-stage launch process, and will be followed by v1 mainnet.

* **Tokenholders can nominate validators** - Tokenholders earn staking rewards for securing the network.  <br/>
* **Network governance is encouraged** - Tokenholders can take part in proposing and voting on changes to network configuration to define the optimal network configuration in preparation for the alpha release. <br/>

Its functionality is limited and is riskier than networks that will follow it, and involves regularly scheduled software upgrades and downtime. There will probably be some growing pains as the network is stress-tested and upgrades are rolled out.

**[Mainnet incidents](https://blog.vega.xyz/tagged/vega-incident-reports)**: Vega publishes information about mainnet incidents and their resolutions on the blog.

## How can I use Vega?

#### Vega Wallet
* [Get a Vega Wallet](../tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/latest/create-wallet): You'll need it for staking, and you can connect it to Fairground, and use it for trading on Vega Console (through the wallet). 

#### Token management and network governance 
* [Mainnet token interface](https://token.vega.xyz): Interact with your $VEGA tokens on the token interface.
* [Fairground token interface](https://governance.fairground.wtf): You can also try out the interface using testnet tokens, if you want to familiarise yourself with it first.

#### Fairground, Vega's testnet
* [Learn about Fairground](https://fairground.wtf): Though trading isn't enabled on mainnet, you can try trading on Fairground. Place an order, track your positions, and explore the margin mechanism using Fairground. Keep an eye on the site for incentive opportunities, too.
