Vega provides several tools to make it easier to interact with the protocol. 

For restricted mainnet, those tools include:
* **[Vega Wallet](/docs/tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/create-wallet)**, which you will use to connect to a network to associate tokens for staking, and to sign messages.
* **[$VEGA Token website](https://token.vega.xyz)**, where you can stake your tokens to nominate the validators that run the network, participate in network goveranance, and earn and claim rewards.
* **[Vega Tools repo](https://github.com/vegaprotocol/vegatools)**, a set of utilities for inspecting and interacting with a Vega network through the APIs.
