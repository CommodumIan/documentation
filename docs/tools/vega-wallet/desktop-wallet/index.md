## Generate new wallet
If you don't already have a Vega wallet, create a new wallet. 

1. Open the app
2. Click on "Create new wallet" 
3. Enter a wallet name of your choice, and a passphrase.

5. Choose a Vega network to connect to: Click on the arrow in the bottom bar of the app. 

## Restore existing wallet
If you already have a Vega wallet with keys, recover the wallet using your recovery phrase. 

1. Open the app. 
2. Click on "Use recovery phrase"
3. Enter your recovery phrase, exactly in the order that it was first presented to you. 
4. Choose your wallet version (1 or 2). 
5. Choose a Vega network to connect to: Click on the arrow in the bottom bar of the app. 

## Troubleshooting
The Vega Wallet desktop app does not yet have the full functionality of the CLI wallet app.

### Not supported
To do any of the following, you will need to use the **[CLI wallet](docs/tools/vega-wallet/cli-wallet/)**:
* Sign transactions 
* Customise key details 
* Isolate keys 

### Wallet recovery provides wrong keys
