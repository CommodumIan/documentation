Due to the distributed nature of Vega, most of the APIs are served from a data node, and a few from a core node. This means there is no single API server, and users will need to choose a node to connect to.

This differs from centralised services, as you can't connect to an API server run by a single company, nor does it require a specific access token. 

Below, find a list of all the public endpoints available for this network.
