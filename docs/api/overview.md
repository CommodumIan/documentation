The Vega protocol provides the backbone to form a network specifically built to support trading of financial products on markets proposed and voted on by members of the Vega community.

There are several ways to interact with Vega through APIs and smart contracts, and below you can learn more about the overall technical structure, the reference documentation, and tutorials that are currently available.

As most of the APIs are designed to be used for trading-related queries, the best place to try them out is on the testnet network, also known as Fairground. The public endpoints differ between testnet and mainnet, as do the network configurations your Vega-compatible wallet needs in order to connect. See the public endpoints page for details. You can switch between documentation of the networks' software versions in the top menu bar on every page.

The easiest way to get started with Vega programmatically is by using [REST](./rest/overview.md). There are also [gRPC](./grpc/overview.md) and [GraphQL](./graphql/generated.md) endpoints geared towards users with specific requirements. For more about the endpoints they provide, go to their specific sections.

## Decentralised network [WIP]
Because Vega is a decentralised network run by independent validators, there are a number of different servers that you'll need to interact while working with the network - data will generally be recieved from one service and transactions will be sent to another. See the [the next section on data flow](#data-flow).

The distributed nature of the network, and the fact that all elements are run by individual contributors, you may need to find or run your own data node (more below) that connects to the Vega network to suit your requirements.
<!--    There are not, as a matter of course, public endpoints for mainnet API users
    To use APIs, a developer will need access to an instance of the relevant software (Wallet, node, or data node depending).
    For Fairground, the project team operate a number of nodes and data nodes with publicly available endpoints.
    The official Fairground wallet release will be pre-configured with known nodes, including those operated by the project team, at the time of release.
    The official Mainnet wallet release may be pre-configured with any publicly announced nodes at the time of release.
    Anyone that plans to build significant integrations, trading bots, power backed services, etc. should expect to run their own data node (or pay someone else to, if the option exists).
-->

## Data flow
Most of the data you will want to access will come from the trading data REST service. This is served by a 'data node' - servers that read from the event stream (event queue), from a Vega core node and produce a database of the current state, and in some cases store the past state. These data nodes are where you will read data from. 

To send in a transaction - you'll need to use a Vega wallet, which will combine your command with a signature and public key, and send that bundle, which makes up the transaction, to a validator node to be included in the chain.

<!--
This guide will use a wallet server running on localhost to 'write' data, and a specific data node to read data from. Depending on your use case, you may eventually run your own data source, or host a wallet on a remote machine.
-->

## Core nodes
Vega's chain is built using the Tendermint consensus mechanism. Read more about Tendermint in their [documentation](https://docs.tendermint.com/). You can see what version of Tendermint the Vega core is using by checking the [statistics endpoint](../api/rest/core/core-service-statistics.api.mdx) for the `chainVersion`.

The Vega core processes each transaction in order, from a block that's been created by Tendermint, by validating and then executing the transaction. When the transaction is executed, it will trigger actions in the core. For example, an order submission could enter the order book, match other orders, create trades, etc. The core is comprised of the order books, risk engines, governance mechanisms, market lifecycle, and other essential protocol functions.

## Authentication
Authentication takes several forms when interacting with Vega. When requesting data from a standard data node, such as through a query, you don't need to authenticate nor do you need an API token. Service providers offering free or paid data nodes may require you to authenticate, however. If this is the case you will need to refer to the provider's documentation for details of how to do so.

If you want to interact with the network, you'll need to ensure that you have a Vega Wallet, which provides authentication in the form of a signature when sending transactions. 

When creating any scripts or software to interact with Vega, you'll need a wallet authentication token. See the [Wallet API guides to get started](./vega-wallet/before-you-start.md).

## Sending transactions to the chain
When sending transactions, you'll need a Vega Wallet with at least one keypair, and have the wallet service running. You'll need to have your Vega public key (also known as a party ID) to hand, as well as the relevant transaction data, in order to submit your transaction.

To access the Vega network, the wallet needs to be configured with the location of one of more data nodes.

When your client wants to send a transaction using the Vega wallet API, it will construct the transaction in JSON and pass it to the wallet. The wallet performs a client-side proof-of-work calculation, signs the transaction and forwards it to a validator node before it is added to a block. It is also possible to have the wallet sign a transaction without sending it, if needed.

You can see a full list of transaction types on the [commands API](./grpc/vega/commands/v1/commands.proto).

### Transaction hashes
Once a transaction has been successfully submitted to the chain, you receive the transaction's hash from the wallet. A transaction hash is a unique identifier for the transaction, and can be used to find that transaction and check its status on a Vega block explorer. Note that a transaction can only be seen by the block explorer once it's been processed by the network and been propagated to the Vega node on the block explorer backend.

Depending on transaction type, most will be given an ID, derived from the transaction hash, which is specific to the object the transaction creates once it's processed. You can use that object-specific ID with the relevant endpoint to then get richer, more detailed information about it. 

For example, a submitted order will receive an order ID once the transaction to submit the order has been accepted into a block. You can use the REST endpoint to [get order by ID](./rest/data-v2/trading-data-service-get-order.api.mdx).

## Versioning
Once the latest code is prepared for a release, it's deployed to a testnet, where the latest features and updates can be trialled. When and if the validator node operators agree that a new version contains changes that should be accepted into mainnet, and is sufficiently stable, they will deploy the code on their nodes and vote on chain to signal readiness to upgrade. 

Find out what version a data node is running with the [data node info endpoint](./rest/data-v2/trading-data-service-info.api.mdx).

Breaking APIs changes go through a deprecation cycle, and are announced in the summary for each [release](../releases/overview.md).

The documentation on this site covers the core software version running on the Vega Fairground testnet, and the version on the Vega mainnet. Check which version's documentation you're viewing (and switch between them) by referring to the top navigation bar for each page. 

See the [releases page](../releases/overview.md) for a summary of each software release and links to the full changelog on GitHub. 

## Available frameworks [WIP]

### REST
REST provides endpoints for querying for trading data, account information, ledger movements, asset and market information, and much more. The bulk of data can be acquired by querying the trading data API, which is served through data nodes.

[Using REST](./rest/overview.md): Read the REST overview for everything you need to know before using the endpoints.

### WebSocket
WebSocket endpoints offer real-time updates to changes in the state of the Vega network, allowing subscriptions to events such as per-market trades or changes to a party's position.

### gRPC
gRPC provides fast and efficient communication, and supports near real time streaming of updates from Vega.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is used for building UIs that require complex queries. 

## Ethereum bridges
Vega uses ERC-20 assets from Ethereum, and to facilitate inter-chain interactions between Vega and Ethereum, those assets are then transferred through a series of smart contract bridges. These bridges provide a seamless experience for users, allowing them to use Ethereum assets on the (non-Ethereum) Vega chain.

Moreover, these smart contract bridges operate just like any other smart contract on Ethereum, meaning that users can interact with them directly using an Ethereum JSON-RPC node or a service like [Etherscan â†—](https://etherscan.io/), which provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.

### Smart contracts

* [ERC20 Bridge Logic](./bridge/contracts/ERC20_Bridge_Logic.md)
  * Contains the functions necessary to deposit, withdraw, list assets, etc. It's controlled by Multisig Control and controls Asset Pool.
* [ERC20 Asset Pool](./bridge/contracts/ERC20_Asset_Pool.md)
  * Holds deposited assets and remits them to provided addresses based on orders from the assigned Bridge Logic. It is controlled by Bridge Logic and Multisig Control.
* [Multisig Control](./bridge/contracts/MultisigControl.md)
  * Handles verification of orders signed by a threshold of validators. 
* [Staking Bridge](./bridge/contracts/Vega_Staking_Bridge.md)
  * Allows users to deposit and withdraw VEGA tokens for staking. The VEGA tokens are always controlled exclusively by the tokenholder, even when on the Staking Bridge. Stake can be removed at any time by the tokenholder.
* VEGA Token contract
  * ERC20 token smart contract.
* Vesting contract
  * All VEGA tokens are issued through this. Handles the linear vesting of VEGA tokens and allows users to stake VEGA they own (vested or not).

## Vega Wallet integration
If you're looking to integrate the Vega Wallet with a dApp or bots, you'll most likely need to use the wallet API, as the Vega Wallet can be used to authenticate and send transactions to the network.

The **Wallet API** uses JSON-RPC with an HTTP wrapper. You can review the [guidance on how to use the API](./vega-wallet/before-you-start.md) before jumping into the reference documentation. 

To use the Wallet API to programmatically interact with the network for your own transactions, [download a Vega Wallet](../tools/vega-wallet/index.md) before starting.

## Tutorials
Tutorials provide the information you'll need about the protocol to understand and use the guide, as well as instructions on how to interact with scripts, API calls, or other code.
